#newsfeed
##Description
This program takes an URL of an RSS feed (in my case a Polish news website RSS feed), parses it and prints the RSS entries in the CLI in a formatted manner.

I use it for getting the bare news from [a news website](http://www.tvn24.pl/) printed to the CLI, because navigating through the website itself gives me headaches.

  `git clone https://github.com/hunter212yy/newsfeed.git`
