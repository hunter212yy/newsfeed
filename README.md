#newsfeed
##Description
This program takes a url of an RSS feed (in my case url of a Polish news website), parses it and prints the RSS entries in the CLI.

I use it for getting the bare news from [a news website](http://www.tvn24.pl/) printed to the CLI, because navigating through the website itself gives me headaches.
